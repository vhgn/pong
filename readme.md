# Development

Make sure you initiated and updated the submodules.

```shell
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Compile `check` and install it on your machine for tests (see details in its own readme).
Makefile contains `debug` target for quick compile-and-run.
Use `make test` to compile tests and run.
Use `make` to compile and `make run` to run the default executable, or use the quick alias `make debug`.
