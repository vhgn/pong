> A pong, just a pong

A classical pong game with slightly configurable appearance.

# Play

**TLDR** Run `make`.

Use `make` command to initialize submodules, update them, compile and run the game.

# Development

Make sure you initiated and updated the submodules.

```sh
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Makefile contains `all` target for a quick compile-and-run.
